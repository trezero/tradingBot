I am continuing development of a GPU-accelerated cryptocurrency trading bot project from another system. I have a detailed XML file containing the project's structure, history, and current state. Please analyze the windsurfNotes.xml file to:

1. Understand the project's architecture and current implementation
2. Familiarize yourself with the existing optimizations and GPU acceleration strategies
3. Be ready to assist with the next development steps

Key aspects to focus on:
- The moving average strategy implementation with GPU acceleration using CuPy
- The parallel optimization framework using multiprocessing
- The backtesting system architecture
- Current development status and planned enhancements

After reviewing the XML file, please:
1. Confirm your understanding of the project
2. Highlight any areas where you need additional clarification
3. Suggest which of the planned next steps we should prioritize

I want to ensure you have a complete understanding of the project before we continue development. Please ask any questions if you need more details about specific components or implementations.
